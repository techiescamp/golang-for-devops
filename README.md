# Golang for DevOps: A Practical Roadmap with Hands-on Tasks

Want to learn Golang for DevOps? Follow this roadmap with hands-on tasks and real-world automation examples to level up your skills.

## Overview
This roadmap is designed to help DevOps engineers learn Golang while building practical tools for cloud operations, automation, and Kubernetes.

## **Week 1: Golang Basics**
### **Goal:** Get comfortable with Go syntax and key features.
- âœ… Install Go and set up your environment
- âœ… Learn Go's basic syntax: variables, loops, conditionals
- âœ… Understand functions, methods, and structs
- âœ… Learn error handling in Go
- âœ… Work with arrays, slices, and maps
- âœ… Explore Goroutines (for concurrency)

**Practice Project:**  
- Build a CLI tool that pings services/endpoints and reports their status (`net/http` package).

---

## **Week 2: File Handling & Configurations**
### **Goal:** Read/write files, process YAML/JSON, and handle configurations.
- âœ… Learn file I/O in Go (`os`, `io`, `bufio` packages)
- âœ… Work with JSON and YAML parsing (`encoding/json`, `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`)
- âœ… Read environment variables (`os.Getenv`)
- âœ… Learn how to create and use configuration files

**Practice Project:**  
- Create a utility that reads and validates YAML/JSON configuration files before deployment.

---

## **Week 3: Networking & HTTP**
### **Goal:** Build command-line tools for cloud and Kubernetes-related operations.
- âœ… Understand the `net/http` package for making API calls
- âœ… Work with REST APIs using `http.Client`
- âœ… Learn HTTP server basics with `net/http`
- âœ… Explore Goâ€™s built-in templating system

**Practice Projects:**  
- Develop a simplified command-line tool that performs common cloud operations.  
- Create an API that exposes system metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage.  

---

## **Week 4: Concurrency & Scheduling**
### **Goal:** Learn how to handle multiple tasks efficiently.
- âœ… Learn Goroutines and Channels
- âœ… Work with the `sync` package
- âœ… Learn how to create a job scheduler using `time.Ticker` and `cron` packages
- âœ… Handle concurrent requests and workers

**Practice Project:**  
- Develop a simple scheduler that runs tasks at specified intervals.  

---

## **Week 5: Kubernetes Development Basics**
### **Goal:** Work with Kubernetes API in Go.
- âœ… Learn how to interact with Kubernetes API using `client-go`
- âœ… Understand CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions)
- âœ… Explore controllers, webhooks, and operators

**Practice Projects:**  
- Create a simple operator that manages a custom resource.  
- Build a webhook that validates or mutates Kubernetes resources before they're created or updated.  

---

## **Week 6: Advanced Kubernetes Tools**
### **Goal:** Automate security and RBAC-related tasks.
- âœ… Learn how to create Kubernetes controllers
- âœ… Work with RBAC policies in Kubernetes
- âœ… Implement logging and monitoring features in Go

**Practice Projects:**  
- Develop a controller that watches specific resources and takes actions when they change.  
- Create a CLI tool that analyzes and visualizes RBAC permissions across your cluster.  
- Build a CLI that validates security contexts on pods and containers.  

---

## **Week 7: System Utilities & Performance Testing**
### **Goal:** Build tools to analyze and optimize systems.
- âœ… Learn how to read system resource usage (`syscall`, `os/exec`)
- âœ… Work with Go profiling and benchmarking (`pprof`)
- âœ… Learn about log parsing and regex (`regexp` package)

**Practice Projects:**  
- Develop a utility that synchronizes files between directories or systems.  
- Build a tool that generates traffic to test application performance.  
- Create a program that parses log files and extracts useful information.  

---

## **Week 8: Final Project & Best Practices**
### **Goal:** Bring everything together and follow Go best practices.
- âœ… Learn best practices for writing idiomatic Go code
- âœ… Understand Go modules and dependency management
- âœ… Explore testing in Go (`testing` package)
- âœ… Write a complete Go project with proper documentation

**Final Project:**  
- Pick one or more of the projects above and refine them into production-ready tools.  

---

## **Next Steps**
- Contribute to open-source Golang projects in DevOps
- Explore Go frameworks like Cobra (for CLI tools) and Fiber (for web APIs)
- Learn how to package and distribute Go applications

### ðŸ“Œ **Happy Coding! ðŸš€**
